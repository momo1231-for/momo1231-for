🤝 Looking to Collaborate: Network Security and Vulnerability Assessment projects. Whether it's designing secure systems and infrastructure, analyzing threats, or mitigating risks.

🚀 Outside the world of tech: 

I enjoy growing and communing with music whether by singing, playing, or learning an instrument, or sometimes just listening

📚 I’m a big fan of personal development and financial empowerment books! Some of my favorites are:

✨ No Excuses by Brian Tracy — a powerhouse in self-growth and discipline.
💰 Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki — a game-changer in financial literacy.

✈️ I love traveling! Although it’s been a while and I haven’t explored many places yet, I am ready for adventure and my curiosity is burning.
